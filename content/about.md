I'm Emanuele Civini, a CS student interested in cryptography and its applications.
As of now I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in CyberSecurity with a focus on cryptography. Alongside this I'm also a Software Engineer at [BlockInvest](https://blockinvest.it).

I use this website as a place to write cool stuff I discover, show my experiments and stuff like this.
